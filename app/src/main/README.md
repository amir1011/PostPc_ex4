Answer to hypothetical question:
Im jUnit test we have a test timeout that looks like this: @Test(timeout = 200) -- it's means that
after 200 ms the test will stop and fail (java.lang.Exception: test timed out after 5000 milliseconds)
So its satisfy our requiments about testing environments time and the real app (production environment)
In Kotlin we can use withTimeout(xxxL) {...} condition.
